## Overview
Trivia Quiz is a simple yet dynamic application where users can test their knowledge through a 10-question quiz. The app comprises three main pages:
1. **Home Page**: Allows users to start the quiz.
2. **Quiz Page**: Displays the quiz questions with answer options.
3. **Results Page**: Shows the userâ€™s score after completing the quiz.

This application uses client-server architecture. The server handles question selection, scoring, and serves the HTML, CSS, and JS files.
